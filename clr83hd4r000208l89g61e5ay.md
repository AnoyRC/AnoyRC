# Introduction

Web3 has revolutionized how we interact with decentralized applications (dApps), and communication is a crucial aspect of enhancing user experience. In this blog post, we'll guide you through creating a Web3 chat app in just one day, leveraging the power of Push Protocol. Push Protocol is a web3 communication network that facilitates cross-chain notifications and messaging for dApps, wallets, and services.

We'll use a powerful tech stack including Next.js for front-end development, Tailwind CSS for styling, the Push Protocol SDK for communication, React Redux for state management, and Wagmi for wallet integration. Let's dive in!

# Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Next.js App

Create a new Next.js app using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

My Configuration :

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704881256106/808763ee-c8b6-46cf-8dff-098bca1d6a4d.png align="center")

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages for Push Protocol, React Redux, Wagmi, and Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm i @pushprotocol/restapi @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux ethers@5.7 viem@1.19.13 wagmi@1.4.10 boring-avatars @material-tailwind/react @heroicons/react
```

`@heroicons/react` for Icons

`@material-tailwind/react` for UI Components

`boring-avatars` for Generating avatars based on the address of the user

We are using a specific version of `ethers@5.7` `viem@1.19.13` and `wagmi@1.4.10` . *(I consider them the best version for the development of web3 Dapps)*

# Setting up React-Redux and Toolkit

## Creating a store and a slice

Create a folder and name it redux. Inside that create a `store.js` file.

```javascript
"use client";

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import pushSlice from "@/redux/slice/pushSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    push: pushSlice,
  },

  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware({
      serializableCheck: false,
    }),
});
```

Now, you will notice there is an unknown file import named `pushSlice`. Let's make that.

Create a folder and name it `slice`. Inside that create a `pushSlice.js` file.

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const pushSlice = createSlice({
  name: "push",

  initialState: {
    user: null,
    chats: null,
    requests: null,
    stream: null,
    data: null,
    addDialog: false,
  },

  reducers: {
    setUser: (state, action) => {
      state.user = action.payload;
    },
    setChats: (state, action) => {
      state.chats = action.payload;
    },
    setRequests: (state, action) => {
      state.requests = action.payload;
    },
    setStream: (state, action) => {
      state.stream = action.payload;
    },
    setData: (state, action) => {
      state.data = action.payload;
    },
    handleAddDialog: (state, action) => {
      state.addDialog = !state.addDialog;
    },
  },
});

export const {
  setUser,
  setChats,
  setRequests,
  setStream,
  setData,
  handleAddDialog,
} = pushSlice.actions;

export default pushSlice.reducer;
```

These are global states that would be needed later on. For now, let's keep the variables and function names that way.

## Creating a provider

As `Nextjs` runs both on the server side and the client side. We need to specify if we need to use the client or not. And for using Redux and its toolkit, we need all the files working on the client side.

Go to the r`oot` folder. Create a new folder and name it `providers`. Inside that create a `reduxProvider.js` file.

```javascript
"use client";

import { store } from "@/redux/store";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

export const ReduxProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
};

export default ReduxProvider;
```

And lastly, let's add that inside our `layout.js` file located inside our `app` folder.

```javascript
import { Poppins } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";
import ReduxProvider from "@/providers/reduxProvider";

const poppins = Poppins({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  weight: ["200", "300", "400", "500", "600", "700", "800", "900"],
});

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={poppins.className}>
        <ReduxProvider>
          {children}
        </ReduxProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Congratulations !! You have successfully integrated `react-redux` in our app.

# Setting Up Wagmi

## Creating a Provider

For this guide, we would only connect to Metamask and Coinbase Wallet. Open the `providers` folder that we created earlier. Create a `wagmiProvider.js` file.

```javascript
"use client";
import { WagmiConfig, createConfig, configureChains, mainnet } from "wagmi";
import { publicProvider } from "wagmi/providers/public";
import { MetaMaskConnector } from "wagmi/connectors/metaMask";
import { CoinbaseWalletConnector } from "wagmi/connectors/coinbaseWallet";

const { chains, publicClient, webSocketPublicClient } = configureChains(
  [mainnet],
  [publicProvider()]
);

const config = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [
    new MetaMaskConnector({ chains }),
    new CoinbaseWalletConnector({
      chains,
      options: {
        appName: "wagmi",
      },
    }),
  ],
  publicClient,
  webSocketPublicClient,
});

export const WagmiProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return <WagmiConfig config={config}>{children}</WagmiConfig>;
};
```

Lastly, Add the provider to our `layout.js` file located inside our `app` folder.

```javascript
import { Poppins } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";
import { WagmiProvider } from "@/providers/wagmiProvider";
import ReduxProvider from "@/providers/reduxProvider";

const poppins = Poppins({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  weight: ["200", "300", "400", "500", "600", "700", "800", "900"],
});

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={poppins.className}>
        <ReduxProvider>
          <WagmiProvider>{children}</WagmiProvider>
        </ReduxProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Congratulations !! `Wagmi` is ready to use. Let's connect some wallets. Shall we?

# Frontend File Structure

Let's Make a simple file structure and UI for our client. After all, we need to complete it in 1 Day.

## Routes

1. "/" - We have a home page where users will connect and initiate push protocol.
    
2. "/dashboard" - a dashboard to see all the chats and requests in one place.
    
3. "/chat/:id" - a chat window where the users can chat with each other.
    

# UI

* Connect window in "/" route.

The UI is made using material tailwind, see the GitHub Repository for code.

# Push Protocol Basics

## Initialize Push

Source: Link

```javascript
const user = await PushAPI.initialize(signer, {
    env: CONSTANTS.ENV.PROD,
});
```

Use `initialize` function immediately after connecting *(using useEffect maybe)* or assign this function to a button when the user has connected with their wallet.

The `user` will be needed for all other function calls, so store it in redux, so that we can globally access the object.

```javascript
if (user) {
    if (!user.readMode) {
        dispatch(setUser(user));
        streamChat(user);
        router.push("/dashboard");
    }
}
```

Source: [Link](https://github.com/AnoyRC/quick3-messenger/blob/64a27ea10111ad459b723c3774efffce47f97a0d/app/(home)/page.js#L69C18-L69C18)

Check for `user.readMode` as it checks if the user has signed or not.

## Stream

Source: [Link](https://github.com/AnoyRC/quick3-messenger/blob/64a27ea10111ad459b723c3774efffce47f97a0d/hooks/usePush.js#L38C11-L38C11)

```javascript
const streamChat = async (user) => {
    const stream = await user.initStream(
      [CONSTANTS.STREAM.CHAT, CONSTANTS.STREAM.CHAT_OPS],
      {
        filter: {
          channels: ["*"],
          chats: ["*"],
        },
        connection: {
          retries: 3,
        },
        raw: false,
      }
    );
    
    //Check for Changes in Chat or others
    stream.on(CONSTANTS.STREAM.CHAT, (data) => {
      dispatch(setData(data));
    });

    //Check for Changes in Chat Operations
    stream.on(CONSTANTS.STREAM.CHAT_OPS, (data) => {
      dispatch(setData(data));
    });

    // Connect 
    stream.connect();
    
    //Set Globally to Disconnect Later
    dispatch(setStream(stream));
  };
```

`Stream` checks for any chats, chat requests, or messages received from any user. Try to connect to the stream as soon as the user initializes push. So that you can get live updates of chats and chat requests.

Save the `stream` globally, so that you can disconnect the stream when the user has logged out. And store the data received from the stream to check for changes.

```javascript
const stream = useSelector((state) => state.push.stream);

if (stream) {
    stream.disconnect();
}
```

## Fetch Chats / Contacts

Source: Link

```javascript
const fetchChats = async () => {
    const chat = await user.chat.list("CHATS");
    dispatch(setChats(chat));
};
```

Fetch Chats of the users you are already talking to. Use this function when loading into the dashboard to show the existing contacts

## Fetch Chat Requests

Source: Link

```javascript
const fetchRequests = async () => {
    const requests = await user.chat.list("REQUESTS");
    dispatch(setRequests(requests));
};
```

The first Message from any user becomes a chat request. This feature is given to avoid spam from random users. Fetch Chat requests on the request tab of the dashboard.

## Accept Chat Requests

Source: Link

```javascript
const acceptRequest = async (walletAddress) => {
    await user.chat.accept(walletAddress);
    fetchChats();
    fetchRequests();
};
```

Accept Chat Requests received from the given wallet address. Use this function where you let the user accept chat requests from other unknown wallet addresses.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704906982983/005507a2-0a70-43e1-b51c-7e337a4a493f.png align="center")

## Reject Chat Requests

Source: [Link](https://github.com/AnoyRC/quick3-messenger/blob/64a27ea10111ad459b723c3774efffce47f97a0d/hooks/usePush.js#L32C3-L32C3)

```javascript
const rejectRequest = async (walletAddress) => {
    await user.chat.reject(walletAddress);
    fetchChats();
    fetchRequests();
};
```

Reject Chat Requests received from the given wallet address. Use this function where you let the user reject chat requests from other unknown wallet addresses.

## Fetch Chat History

Source: [Link](https://github.com/AnoyRC/quick3-messenger/blob/64a27ea10111ad459b723c3774efffce47f97a0d/app/(home)/chat/%5Bid%5D/page.js#L37C1-L37C1)

```javascript
 const fetchHistory = async () => {
    const history = await user.chat.history(did);
    setHistory(history);
 };
```

Fetch Chat history based on the given did. Did can be found in the user object when you Fetch Chats / Contacts. Fetch Chat history when the user opens a particular chat to send a message.

## Send Message

Source: [Link](https://github.com/AnoyRC/quick3-messenger/blob/64a27ea10111ad459b723c3774efffce47f97a0d/app/(home)/chat/%5Bid%5D/page.js#L42C3-L42C3)

```javascript
const sendMessage = async () => {
    await user.chat.send(did, {
      type: "Text",
      content: message,
    });
    setMessage("");
    fetchHistory();
};
```

Sends the message after taking input from the user. The message can be any type, for example, file, gif, image, or text. For this project, we are only sending text messages.
