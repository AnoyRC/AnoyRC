# Introduction

Web3 games have been gaining popularity over the past few years. Unlike traditional games, web3 games are powered by blockchain technology, which offers players more control over their gaming experience and the ability to earn real-world rewards. However, despite their potential, web3 games have been struggling to onboard users. In this blog post, we will explore the reasons why web3 games are failing to attract and retain users. And, How Reneverse solves it !!

# What is Reneverse?

[Reneverse](https://reneverse.io) is a platform that helps you to build Blockchain Integrated games without having to know Solidity or Rust. It manages everything from onboarding users to web3 gaming to easing the development and coding required to integrate your game with blockchain.

# The Complexity of Web3 Technology

One of the main reasons why web3 games are struggling to onboard users is the complexity of the underlying technology. Blockchain technology is still relatively new and not widely understood. The idea of owning and managing digital assets can be overwhelming for many users, especially those who are not tech-savvy. Moreover, the process of setting up a wallet, buying and transferring cryptocurrency, and interacting with smart contracts can be confusing and time-consuming.

# Lack of User-Friendly Interfaces

Another reason why web3 games are failing to onboard users is the lack of user-friendly interfaces. Many web3 games have complicated user interfaces that are not intuitive or easy to use. Players often have to navigate through multiple screens and menus to perform simple tasks, such as buying or selling assets. Moreover, some web3 games require players to have a deep understanding of smart contracts and blockchain technology to participate fully, which can be a turn-off for casual players.

# Limited Availability of Web3 Games

Finally, the limited availability of web3 games is also a significant barrier to user adoption. Currently, there are only a handful of web3 games available, and most of them are still in the early stages of development. This limited selection means that users have fewer options to choose from, which can make it difficult to find a game that matches their interests and preferences. Moreover, many web3 games require the use of specific cryptocurrencies, which can also limit their appeal to a broader audience.

# How Reneverse Solves Onboarding of Users in Web3 Games

## Simplifies the Process of Buying and Transferring Assets

One of the major challenges for new users is setting up a wallet, buying and transferring digital assets, and interacting with smart contracts. Reneverse simplifies this process of integrating all of it in the Reneverse portal and offering user-friendly interfaces that guide players through the process step-by-step.

With the introduction of the **<mark>$Rene</mark>** token, seamless transactions and value transfer between different games are achievable within the ReneVerse ecosystem. Players would be able to earn or acquire the currency in one game and then use it in another game without the need for complex conversions or multiple wallets. This would promote interoperability and create a more interconnected gaming experience.

## More Intuitive and Accessible Interfaces

Many web3 games have complicated user interfaces that are not intuitive or easy to use. Players often have to navigate through multiple screens and menus to perform simple tasks, such as buying or selling assets.

To address this issue, Reneverse Unity SDK provides a robust library of functions and variables so that game developers can focus on creating more intuitive and accessible interfaces rather than focusing on complex methods to integrate their games into the blockchain. Additionally, game developers can offer in-game tutorials and guides to help players navigate the interface and understand the game mechanics.

## Expanding the Selection of Available Games

The limited availability of web3 games is also a significant barrier to user adoption. To overcome this challenge, game developers need to focus on creating more web3 games and expanding the selection of available games.

Reneverse is bringing the next generation of Web3 games accessible to every user. Empowering and enabling players and developers to take part in the decentralized future. Reneverse is partnering with other developers and blockchain projects to create new and innovative games. Additionally, game developers can offer incentives to players to try out new games, such as rewards for completing certain tasks or achievements.
